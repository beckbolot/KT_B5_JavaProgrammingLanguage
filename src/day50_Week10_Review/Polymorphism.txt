Poly + Morphism (Many Forms)
• Ability of the objects to take on many forms
• Occurs when reference type is parent class/interface and object type is child

Calling method in polymorphism
• Only the methods in reference type can be called
• When we call a method, it will call overridden version from a child class
• If method is not overridden, it will call parent/super class version

Polymorphism Rules
• Reference type can be parent class or interface
• Object type can be any extending or implementing child class
• Reference type decides what is accessible
• Object type decides which implementation of the method to be executed when
the method is called

Reference Type Castings
• Casting one reference type to another
• There must be IS A (inheritance) relation between the object type and reference
type we are casting it to, otherwise ClassCastException will be thrown
