Collections

        Data Structures:
            Array
            Collection
            Map

        Array:              size is fixed
                            supports both primitive and non primitive data types
                            supports only one homegenous (one type) data types in an array

        Collection(I):         size is dynamic
                            supports only non-primitive data types (Wrapper)
                            supports different types of objects
                            Collection is an interface

                            List(I):        Accepts duplicates
                                            preserve insertion order
                                            has an index number

                                    Arraylist:      internally uses Array, dynamic array
                                                    ACCESSING the data is fast (get())

                                    LinkedList:     uses doubly linked list(previous node reference, data, next node reference)
                                                    ADDING/REMOVING dat is faster (add(), remove())
                                                    requires more memory size

                                    Vector          thread safe - synchronised
                                                    internally uses array
                                        Stack:      LIFO(Last In First Out)
