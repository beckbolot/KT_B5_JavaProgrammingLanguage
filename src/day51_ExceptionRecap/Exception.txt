Exception
• An unwanted or unexpected event
• Occurs during the compile time or during the runtime
• There are two categories of exceptions: checked exception and unchecked exception
• To prevent exceptions from crashing our program, we must write code that detects
and handles them

Unchecked Exceptions
• Exceptions that are not checked at compile time
• Occurs during the runtime
• Code will compile even if we do not handle them
• They have IS A relationship with RuntimeException (parent class)

checked Exceptions
• Exceptions that are checked at compile time
• Occurs during the compile time
• Code will not compile if we do not handle them
• They do not have IS A relationship with RuntimeException class

Errors
• Indicates that an illegal operation is being performed
• Occurs during the runtime only
• They can not be recovered, and not recommended to handle them

Exception Handling - try & catch
• To handle an exception (checked or unchecked), we can use try & catch block

Throws Keyword
• Used within the method signature
• Informs the compiler that method throws one of the listed type exception
• Fastest way to get rid of the compilation error that’s caused by a checked exception
