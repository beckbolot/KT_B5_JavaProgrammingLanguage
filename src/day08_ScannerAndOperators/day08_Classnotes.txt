            1. main method
            2. print() & println()
            3. escape chars
            4. primitive variables & String variable
            5. concatenation
            6. casting (implicit, explicit)
            7. arithmetic cperator
            8. scanner class


            Arithmetic Operators
             in math 10/4 = 2.5
                     100/3=33.33333333

             in Java
                    10/4 = 2;
                    100/3= 33;
                    10.0/4= 2.5
                    10/4.0= 2.5

                    20/6 = 3
                    20/6.0=3.3333..

                    remainder %modulus Kalan
                    20%6  =>2
                    10%3  =>1


                    ()
                    /*%
                    -+

                    20*(2-1) =20 * 1 = 20
                    15+2*3+12/4 = 15 + 6 + 3 = 24

                    Casting :
                    // implicit, automatic, widening = casting smaller type to larger
                    // explicit, manual, narrowing  = casting the larger type to smaller (veri kaybi)

                    Scanner

                    1. adim Scanner Classindan bir object nesne olusturuyoruz
                       Scanner scan/input/scanner/  = new Scanner(System.in);

                    2. use scanner methods to get input from user
                       nextInt()
                       nextDouble()
                       nextBoolean()
                       nextLine()

                                 if we are using nextline() method after a scanner method,
                                 We must use an extra nextLine(), before the actual nextline()

                    3. scan.close

                    // ctrl+d  cmd+d    ->  copy a line

                      Ask user to enter each values.
                      Use scanner class and get them one by one
                      use string concatenation to display the phone number as
