Class: Where Objects came from
        A blueprint/Taslak

Object : Instance of a class/Örnek
        Object is real
        Objects can not exist without a class

Custom Class:
	1. Instance variables & instance methods
Instance Variables: Declared inside the class and outside any methods/blocks
                    Each Object has a separate copy of the instance variable

Instance Methods: Does not have static keyword
                  Each Object has a separate copy of the instance methods


	2. Constructors
A special method that every class must have.
It’s used when we create objects of a class.
Constructor is a special method that matches the name of the class and has no return type nor a specifier

this. keyword: used for calling the instance variables & instance methods
this() : used for calling the constructors

Constructor Call:
		1. Constructor can not be called by its name ( this() need to be used )
		2. Only a constructor can call another constructor
		3. Constructor call MUST be at the first step
		4. One constructor can not call more than one constructor
		5. Constructor can not call or contain itself

	3. statics

instance: belong to the object
		each object has its own copy of the instances (can have multiple copies)


static: belongs to the class.
		There is only one copy of statics that's shared by all objects of the class

Static is applicable for the following:
• Variables
• Methods
• Blocks
• Class

Static Methods: Static methods only accept static members

Instance methods can also access static methods and static variables directly
In static methods we can not use the “this” keyword

Static Block:
Static Imports:
